# Screen Time Manager General Design Guide

> Current Saturn-branded surfaces should use `SATURN_BRAND_KIT.md` as the source of truth. This older light Screen Time Manager guide is retained for legacy reference only.

## 1. Brand Identity

Screen Time Manager is a clean, focused productivity tool that helps users control distracting websites, understand their browsing habits, and build better digital discipline.

The product should feel:

- Calm
- Minimal
- Trustworthy
- Focused
- Lightweight
- Practical
- Slightly strict, but not aggressive

The brand should not feel:

- Overly corporate
- Flashy
- Gimmicky
- Wellness-heavy
- Motivational in a cheesy way
- Like a generic AI SaaS product
- Like a dark-mode crypto/startup app

The core idea is simple:

> Screen Time Manager helps users create friction between themselves and distracting websites.

## 2. Product Personality

The product should communicate like a practical focus tool.

It should feel like:

- A helpful guardrail
- A clean browser utility
- A quiet accountability system
- A productivity dashboard
- A tool that respects the user's time

It should not feel like:

- A life coach
- A meditation app
- A parental control app
- A punishment system
- A complicated analytics product

The tone should be clear, direct, and calm.

Good examples:

- "Block distracting websites before they pull you back in."
- "Set limits once. Let Screen Time Manager enforce them."
- "See where your attention is going."
- "Stay focused with simple website limits."

Avoid:

- "Unlock your ultimate productivity potential."
- "Revolutionize your digital wellness."
- "Crush your goals with next-gen focus technology."
- "Transform your life with powerful screen time optimization."

## 3. Visual Direction

The visual style should be inspired by:

- Chrome extension interfaces
- Google-style product design
- Lightweight productivity dashboards
- Clean browser tools
- Simple analytics cards

The product should look like something that belongs inside a browser.

Design priorities:

1. Clarity
2. Trust
3. Speed
4. Simplicity
5. Consistency

Avoid unnecessary decoration. The interface should feel polished, but not flashy.

## 4. Color Palette

## 11. Data Visualization

The product may show user activity, blocked pages, domain usage, or screen time trends.

Charts should be:

- Simple

Use:

- Bar charts
- Small trend lines
- Simple counters
- Daily summaries
- Domain ranking lists

Avoid:

- Complex analytics dashboards

Data should help the user understand behavior quickly.

Good examples:

- "You hit your YouTube limit 3 times today"
- "Most blocked site: youtube.com"

## 12. Copywriting Principles

Copy should be:

- Clear
- Short
- Practical
- Calm
- Direct

The product should not shame the user.

Good:

- "You've reached your daily limit."

- "Take a quick reset before returning."
- "Add sites that usually pull you off task."

Avoid:

- "You failed."
- "You wasted too much time."
- "You have no discipline."
- "Stop being distracted."

The product should create accountability without sounding judgmental.

## 13. Blocked Page Experience

The blocked page is one of the most important brand moments.

It should feel:

- Calm
- Firm
- Minimal
- Helpful

It should clearly show:

- The site that was blocked
- Why it was blocked
- When it becomes available again, if applicable
- A simple next action

Good blocked page copy:

- "This site is blocked right now."
- "You set a limit for youtube.com."
- "Come back tomorrow, or adjust your settings from the extension."
- "Focus block active."

Avoid making the blocked page too playful or too harsh.

## 14. Privacy and Trust

Because the product tracks domains, time, and blocking activity, trust is essential.

Privacy messaging should be clear and visible.

Core privacy message:

> Screen Time Manager only tracks the activity needed to provide website blocking, limits, and usage stats.

The brand should communicate:

- No unnecessary tracking
- No selling user data
- No creepy monitoring
- User control over tracked domains/settings
- Simple, transparent behavior

Privacy copy should be plain English, not legal-sounding unless it is in the actual privacy policy.

## 15. Motion and Animation

Use motion sparingly.

Acceptable:

- Subtle fade-ins
- Small hover transitions
- Smooth expand/collapse
- Gentle loading states

Avoid:

- Parallax-heavy pages
- Constant motion
- Bouncy animations
- Distracting effects
- Flashy startup-style transitions

Since the product is about focus, the design should not be visually distracting.

## 16. Accessibility

The product should be readable and usable.

Requirements:

- Strong color contrast
- Clear focus states
- Keyboard-friendly controls
- Large enough tap/click targets
- Labels for inputs
- Avoid color-only meaning
- Respect reduced motion preferences

The design should feel lightweight, but not at the expense of usability.

## 17. Responsive Design

The product should work well across:

- Chrome extension popup sizes
- Desktop dashboard views
- Mobile website screens
- Tablet-sized layouts

Responsive principles:

- Stack cards on small screens
- Keep buttons large enough
- Avoid cramped analytics
- Prioritize the main action
- Hide nonessential details when space is limited

## 18. Product Consistency Rules

Every Screen Time Manager surface should share the same design language.

This includes:

- Extension popup
- Dashboard
- Blocked page
- Website
- Privacy page
- Feedback page
- Changelog
- Future onboarding
- Future paid/pro pages

Consistency rules:

- Use the same blue
- Use the same card style
- Use the same typography
- Use the same icon style
- Use the same tone of voice
- Use the same spacing logic
- Use the same border and shadow style

The website should not feel like a separate brand from the extension.

## 19. Things to Avoid

Avoid:

- Generic SaaS landing page styling
- Purple/blue AI gradients
- Dark crypto-style design
- Overly motivational language
- Stock photos
- Abstract 3D blobs
- Excessive animations
- Complicated dashboards
- Enterprise-heavy language
- Shame-based copy

## 20. Design Goal

A user should feel within seconds that Screen Time Manager is:

1. Simple
2. Useful
3. Trustworthy
4. Focused
5. Easy to understand
6. Built for real browser-based productivity

The design should make the product feel like a polished Chrome extension that helps users control distractions without adding more noise.
